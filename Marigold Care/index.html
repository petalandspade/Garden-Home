            Marigolds, scientifically known as Tagetes, are annual flowering plants native to 
            Mexico and Central America. They belong to the Asteraceae family and are prized for 
            their daisy-like blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and maroon. Marigolds are not only 
            visually appealing but also serve practical purposes in the garden and beyond.

            There are several popular varieties of marigolds, each with its unique characteristics:

        African Marigolds (Tagetes erecta): Known for their large, robust blooms and tall growth habit, African marigolds add a bold splash of color to garden beds and borders.
        French Marigolds (Tagetes patula): Compact and bushy, French marigolds are perfect for edging, containers, and companion planting. They come in a wide range of colors and often have a distinctive maroon or dark center.
        Signet Marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia): Also called gem marigolds, signet marigolds feature small, finely divided foliage and delicate, edible flowers. They are great for culinary uses and as ornamental plants.

            Planting and Care Tips:
        </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="basic-paragraph">
        <p>
            1. Sunlight: Marigolds thrive in full sunlight and prefer well-draining soil. 
            Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily for optimal growth and blooming.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="basic-paragraph">
        <p>
            2. Watering: Water marigolds moderately, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between 
            waterings. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="basic-paragraph">
        <p>
            3. Deadheading: Regular deadheading (removing spent blooms) promotes continuous 
            flowering and keeps the plants looking tidy. Pinch off faded flowers at their base 
            to encourage new blooms.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>
            4. Pest Control: Marigolds are known for their natural pest-repelling properties, 
            particularly against nematodes in the soil. Planting marigolds near vegetable gardens 
            or susceptible plants can help deter pests.

            5. Companion Planting: Marigolds are excellent companions for vegetables like tomatoes, 
            peppers, and eggplants. They can help repel pests while adding color and beauty to the 
            garden.
