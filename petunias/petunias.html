                ability to thrive in various garden settings. In this blog post, we'll delve into

                Petunias are warm-season annuals that thrive in spring and summer. Plant them 
                after the last frost date in your region for optimal growth. Petunias also do 
                well in fall plantings in areas with mild winters, providing colorful blooms until 
                the first frost.

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Sunlight:</b> Petunias love full sun, so plant them in a location that receives 
                at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
                <b>Soil:</b> Use well-draining soil enriched with organic matter. Petunias prefer 
                slightly acidic soil but can adapt to a range of soil types.
                <b>Watering:</b> Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply when 
                the top inch of soil feels dry.
                <b>Deadheading:</b> Remove spent flowers regularly to encourage continuous blooming 
                and prevent seed formation.
                <b>Fertilization:</b> Apply a balanced fertilizer every 2-4 weeks to promote healthy
                growth and abundant flowering.

            <p>
                Petunias are generally non-toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets. However, as with 
                any plant, it's best to prevent pets from ingesting large quantities of plant 
                material, as this can cause mild gastrointestinal upset.

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Seed Starting:</b> Petunias can be grown from seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before 
                the last frost. Sow seeds in a seed-starting mix, keeping them moist until 
                germination.
                <b>Germination Time:</b> Petunia seeds typically germinate within 7-14 days when 
                kept at around 70°F (21°C).
                <b>ransplanting:</b>T Once seedlings have true leaves, transplant them into 
                individual pots. Harden off seedlings before planting them outdoors after the 
                danger of frost has passed.
