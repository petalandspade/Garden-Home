                Verbena, with its delicate clusters of flowers and trailing growth habit, is a 
                favorite among gardeners for its vibrant colors and long-lasting blooms. In this 
                blog post, we'll dive into the world of verbena, covering planting times, care tips, 
                toxicity concerns for pets, growing from seeds, and its perennial nature.

                When to Plant Verbena:

                Verbena is best planted in spring after the last frost date has passed. It thrives 
                in warm weather and can be planted in containers, hanging baskets, or garden beds 
                where it can cascade gracefully.

                How to Care for Verbena:
            </h2>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Sunlight:</b> Verbena loves full sun but can tolerate partial shade, 
                especially in hotter climates. Ensure it receives at least 6 hours of direct 
                sunlight daily for optimal blooming.
                <b>Soil:</b> Plant verbena in well-draining soil with good fertility. Adding 
                compost or organic matter to the soil before planting can improve moisture 
                retention and nutrient availability.
                <b>Watering:</b> Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply when 
                the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.
                <b>Deadheading:</b> Remove spent blooms regularly to encourage continuous flowering 
                and prevent seed formation. This also helps maintain a neat appearance.
                <b>Fertilization:</b> Use a balanced fertilizer or a fertilizer formulated for 
                flowering plants to promote healthy growth and abundant blooms. Follow the 
                recommended application rates on the fertilizer package.

                Verbena plants are generally considered non-toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets. 
                However, as a precaution, it's always advisable to monitor pets around plants and 
                discourage them from nibbling on foliage or flowers.

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Seed Starting:</b> Verbena seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the 
                last frost date or sown directly outdoors after frost danger has passed. Sow seeds 
                shallowly and keep them consistently moist until germination occurs.
                <b>Germination Time:</b> Verbena seeds typically germinate within 14-21 days under 
                optimal conditions.
                <b>Transplanting:</b> Once seedlings have developed several sets of true leaves, 
                they can be transplanted into the garden or containers.

                Verbena is often grown as a perennial in warmer climates where it can overwinter 
                and return each year. In colder climates, it may behave as an annual or tender 
                perennial, meaning it may not survive harsh winters without protection or may 
                reseed itself in milder climates.
