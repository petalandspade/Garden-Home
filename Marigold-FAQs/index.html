                Marigolds, with their vibrant hues and diverse varieties, have long been 
                cherished in gardens around the world. Let's delve into the enchanting world of 
                marigolds, exploring their characteristics, care, symbolism, and more.

            <h2>
                Are marigolds perennial?

            <p>
                Marigolds are typically grown as annuals, meaning they complete their life cycle 
                within one growing season. However, some perennial marigold varieties exist, such 
                as Tagetes lemmonii, which can survive and bloom for multiple years in suitable 
                climates.

            <p>
                Certain marigold varieties, particularly the Tagetes tenuifolia (signet marigolds), 
                produce edible flowers. These flowers can add a pop of color and a mild, citrusy 
                flavor to salads, desserts, and beverages. It's essential to use only organically 
                grown marigolds meant for culinary purposes.

                Marigolds are considered non-toxic to dogs, cats, and humans. However, while not 
                highly toxic, ingesting large quantities of any plant material can lead to digestive 
                discomfort in pets. It's always best to discourage pets from nibbling on plants and 
                to seek veterinary advice if ingestion occurs. Visit

            <p>
                Marigolds are warm-season plants that thrive in full sunlight. They are 
                typically planted outdoors after the last frost date in spring when soil 
                temperatures have warmed up. In warmer climates, marigolds can be planted in 
                late winter or early spring.

                In Mexican culture, marigolds hold significant symbolism during the Day of the 
                Dead (Dia de los Muertos) festivities. They are used to decorate altars and graves,

                Marigolds are easily grown from seeds, which can be sown directly into the garden 
                soil or started indoors several weeks before the last frost date. Follow seed packet 
                instructions for optimal germination and growth.
