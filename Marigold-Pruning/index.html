            <p>
                Deadheading marigolds is a simple yet effective way to encourage continuous 
                blooming and maintain the plant's appearance. Here's the best way to deadhead 
                marigolds:
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <bold>Timing:</bold> Begin deadheading marigolds when you notice the flowers starting to fade 
                or wilt. Regular deadheading throughout the growing season will promote new blooms 
                and keep the plant looking tidy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <bold>Tools:</bold> You'll need a pair of clean and sharp pruning shears or 
                scissors for deadheading.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <bold>Deadheading Steps:</bold> a. Identify Spent Flowers: Look for flowers that have faded, wilted, or lost their vibrant color. These are the ones that need to be removed.

                b. Locate the Stem: Follow the flower stem down to where it connects to a leaf node or another stem.
                
                c. Make a Clean Cut: Use your pruning shears or scissors to make a clean cut just above the leaf node or junction. Angle the cut slightly to prevent water from pooling on the stem.
                
                d. Remove Entire Flower: Ensure you remove the entire flower head, including any dried petals or sepals, leaving a clean stem behind.
                
                e. Dispose of Removed Flowers: Discard the removed flowers and plant debris to keep the area around the marigolds clean.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <bold>Frequency:</bold> Deadhead marigolds regularly, ideally every few days or 
                whenever you notice spent blooms. This consistent practice encourages the plant 
                to produce more flowers instead of diverting energy into seed production.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <bold>Aftercare:</bold> After deadheading, water the marigolds lightly if needed 
                and continue regular care such as fertilization and pest control as per your usual 
                gardening routine.
        </div>


        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                By following these steps, you'll keep your marigolds looking vibrant and ensure 
                a longer blooming period throughout the growing season. Deadheading not only 
                improves the plant's appearance but also promotes healthier growth and more abundant 
                flowering, enhancing the beauty of your garden or landscape.
