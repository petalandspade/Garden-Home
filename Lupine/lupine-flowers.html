        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Flower Form:</b> Lupines produce tall, spiky flower stalks with densely packed 
                clusters of pea-shaped flowers along the stem.
                <b>Color Variety:</b> From deep blues and purples to soft pinks and whites, 
                lupines offer a wide range of colors to suit different garden themes and color 
                schemes.
                <b>Plant Height:</b>Depending on the variety, lupines can range from compact plants 
                suitable for borders to tall specimens that create dramatic focal points in the 
                garden.
                <b>Attracts Pollinators:</b> The nectar-rich flowers of lupines attract pollinators 
                such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, contributing to a thriving ecosystem.

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Vertical Interest:</b> Lupines add vertical interest to garden beds and borders 
                with their tall flower spikes, creating a dynamic and layered landscape.
                <b>Colorful Display:</b>With their vibrant blooms and diverse color palette, 
                lupines create a stunning visual display, especially when planted in groups or 
                drifts.
                <b>Low Maintenance:</b> Once established, lupines are relatively low maintenance 
                and tolerant of various soil types, making them suitable for beginner and 
                experienced gardeners alike.
                <b>Perennial Beauty:</b> Many lupine varieties are perennial, returning year after 
                year with their delightful blooms, while some are grown as annuals in colder
                climates.

                Growing and Caring for Lupine Flowers:

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Planting Time:</b> Lupine seeds can be sown directly in the garden in spring or 
                fall, or you can start with nursery-grown plants. Ensure they have well-draining 
                soil and receive adequate sunlight.
                <b>Watering:</b> Provide regular watering, especially during dry periods, but 
                avoid waterlogged conditions.
                <b>Soil Requirements:</b> Lupines prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with good 
                drainage. Amending soil with organic matter can improve fertility and drainage.
                <b>Deadheading:</b> Remove spent flower spikes to encourage new blooms and extend 
                the flowering season.
                <b>Support:</b> Tall varieties may benefit from staking or support to prevent toppling in windy conditions.
                <b>Fertilization:</b> Use a balanced fertilizer sparingly, as lupines are 
                sensitive to over-fertilization.
