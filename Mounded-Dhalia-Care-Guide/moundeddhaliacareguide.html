                When to Plant: Mounded dahlias are typically planted in spring after the last frost date, once soil temperatures have warmed up. In warmer climates, they can be planted in late winter or early spring.
Where to Plant: Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil for your mounded dahlias. They thrive in full sunlight, receiving at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
Can You Pot Dahlias? Yes, dahlias can be grown in pots or containers, provided they have adequate space for root development and receive proper care, including regular watering and fertilization. Potted dhalias are 
a great way to decorate any pattio, deck or pergola. Check out <a href="https://pergolaluxe.com/index.html">pergola landscape designs</a> for more decorating ideas.

                Watering: Provide regular watering to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid 
                overwatering to prevent waterlogging.
                Fertilization: Apply a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to promote 
                healthy growth and blooming. Follow fertilizer instructions based on your dahlia's 
                specific needs.
                Deadheading: Remove spent blooms regularly to encourage continuous flowering and 
                maintain a tidy appearance.
                Staking: Tall varieties of mounded dahlias may benefit from staking to support the 
                stems and prevent bending or breaking.

                Dahlias from Seed: While dahlias can be grown from seed, they are commonly 
                propagated from tubers or cuttings due to the time and effort required for seed 
                germination and growth.
                Dahlia Tubers: Dahlias are often grown from tubers, which are planted in spring to 
                produce new plants. Tubers should be planted with the eyes (growth points) facing 
                upward and covered with soil.

                Dahlia Planting: When planting dahlias, dig a hole slightly larger than the tuber 
                size and place the tuber with the eyes facing upward. Cover with soil and water 
                thoroughly.
                Dahlia Garden Design: Incorporate mounded dahlias into your garden design as focal 
                points, borders, or mixed flower beds. Their vibrant blooms and compact growth make 
                them versatile for various garden settings.
