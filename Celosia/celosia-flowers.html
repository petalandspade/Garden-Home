                Celosia is a warm-season annual plant, so it's best to plant it after the danger 
                of frost has passed. In most regions, this means planting celosia outdoors in spring 
                or early summer when temperatures are consistently warm.

            <p>
                <b>Sunlight:</b> Celosia thrives in full sun, so choose a location in your garden 
                that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
                <b>Soil:</b> Celosia prefers well-draining soil with good fertility. Adding 
                compost or organic matter before planting can improve soil quality.
                <b>Watering:</b>Keep the soil evenly moist, especially during hot, dry periods. 
                Avoid overwatering, as soggy soil can lead to root rot.
                <b>Fertilization:</b> Use a balanced fertilizer or a fertilizer formulated for 
                flowering plants to promote healthy growth and abundant blooms. Follow the package 
                instructions for application rates.
                <b>Deadheading:</b> Remove spent blooms regularly to encourage continuous flowering 
                and prevent the plant from diverting energy to seed production.

                Celosia plants are non-toxic to dogs, cats, and other pets, making them a safe 
                choice for pet-friendly gardens. However, it's always a good practice to monitor 
                pets around plants and discourage them from nibbling on foliage or flowers.

                <b>Seed Starting:</b> Celosia seeds can be started indoors 6-8 weeks before the 
                last frost date or sown directly outdoors after frost danger has passed. Sow seeds 
                shallowly and keep them consistently moist until germination.
                <b>Germination Time:</b> Celosia seeds typically germinate within 7-14 days under 
                optimal conditions.
                <b>Transplanting:</b> Once seedlings have developed several sets of true leaves, 
                they can be transplanted into the garden or containers.

                Celosia is primarily grown as an annual, meaning it completes its life cycle 
                within one growing season. However, in some warmer climates, celosia may behave 
                as a short-lived perennial or self-seed to return in subsequent years.
