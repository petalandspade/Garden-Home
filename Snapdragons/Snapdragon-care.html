                Snapdragons are typically planted in early spring after the danger of frost has 
                passed. They can also be planted in late summer for fall blooms, depending on your 
                climate. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade 
                for optimal growth.

                <b>Sunlight:</b> Snapdragons thrive in full sun but can tolerate some shade, 
                especially in hotter climates.
                <b>Soil:</b> Ensure the soil is well-draining and rich in organic matter. 
                Regularly amend the soil with compost or aged manure to promote healthy growth.
                <b>Watering:</b> Keep the soil evenly moist, especially during dry periods. Avoid 
                overwatering to prevent root rot.
                <b>Deadheading:</b> Remove spent flower spikes to encourage continuous blooming and 
                prevent seed production.
                <b>Fertilization:</b> Use a balanced fertilizer during the growing season to provide essential nutrients for robust growth and blooming.

                Snapdragons are not known to be highly toxic to dogs or cats. However, it's 
                essential to monitor pets around plants to prevent ingestion of any plant material. 
                In rare cases, some pets may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort if they 
                consume snapdragon flowers or leaves.

                Growing Snapdragons from Seeds:
            </h2>

        <div class="basic-paragraph">
            <p>
                <b>Seed Starting:</b> Snapdragons can be grown from seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before 
                the last frost date. Start seeds in seed trays filled with seed-starting mix, 
                keeping them moist until germination.
                <b>Germination Time:</b> Snapdragons typically germinate within 10-14 days when 
                kept at optimal temperatures (around 70°F or 21°C).
                <b>Transplanting:</b> Once seedlings have developed true leaves, transplant them 
                into individual pots or directly into the garden after the danger of frost has 
                passed.

                Snapdragons are usually grown as annuals in colder climates, as they are sensitive 
                to frost. However, in milder climates, they can behave as short-lived perennials, 
                especially if provided with adequate winter protection or in areas with mild winters.
