            Pruning geraniums is an essential part of their care routine to promote bushy growth, 
            encourage continuous blooming, and maintain plant health. Here's a step-by-step guide 
            on how to best prune geraniums:

        <p>
            Pruning geraniums is typically done in early spring or late winter, before new growth 
            begins. However, you can also perform light pruning throughout the growing season to 
            remove spent blooms and encourage new growth.

            a. Remove Dead or Yellowing Leaves: Start by inspecting the geranium plant for any dead, 
            yellowed, or diseased leaves. Trim these leaves back to the base of the stem using your 
            pruning shears. Removing these leaves helps improve air circulation and prevents the 
            spread of diseases.

            b. Deadheading Spent Blooms:
            Deadheading is the process of removing faded or spent blooms to encourage the plant 
            to produce new flowers. Locate the spent flower stems (stalks) and follow them down 
            to the nearest leaf node or junction. Use your pruning shears to make a clean cut 
            just above the leaf node, removing the entire flower stalk.
        </p>

            c. Pinching Back for Bushy Growth:
            To promote bushy growth and prevent leggy or straggly stems, consider pinching 
            back the growing tips of the geranium stems. Pinching can be done with your fingers 
            by gently squeezing and removing the tip of the stem where new growth is emerging. 
            This encourages the plant to branch out and produce more compact growth.

            d. Shape and Size Control:
            Depending on your preferences and the growth habits of your geraniums, you can also 
            prune for shaping and size control. Trim back longer or unruly stems to maintain a 
            tidy and balanced appearance. Focus on removing any overly dense or overcrowded areas 
            to improve air circulation within the plant.

            4. Aftercare:
            After pruning, water your geraniums thoroughly to help them recover from the pruning 
            stress. Consider applying a balanced fertilizer to provide nutrients for new growth 
            and flowering.

            5. Maintenance Pruning:
            Throughout the growing season, continue to monitor your geraniums for spent blooms, 
            dead or yellowing leaves, and any pruning needs. Regular maintenance pruning will 
            keep your plants looking healthy and vibrant.

          By following these pruning tips, you can help your geraniums thrive and bloom beautifully, 
          enhancing the appearance of your garden or indoor space. Remember that geraniums are 
          resilient plants, so don't be afraid to trim them back as needed to encourage healthy 
          growth and abundant flowering.
