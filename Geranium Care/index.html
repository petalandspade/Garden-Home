<h2>
    Understanding Geraniums:
</h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
<p>
    Geraniums (Pelargoniums) are popular flowering plants known for their colorful blooms, 
    which come in shades of red, pink, white, and more. They are versatile plants that can 
    be grown both outdoors in gardens or containers and indoors as houseplants. Geraniums make great
    decoration around your yard including container baskets hanging from your pergola. For more

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Light Requirements:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums thrive in full sun to partial shade. Outdoors, place them in a location 
        where they receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. Indoors, choose a bright 
        spot near a window where they can get adequate sunlight.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Watering:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Proper watering is crucial for geraniums. Water them deeply when the soil feels dry 
        to the touch, but allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent 
        overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent 
        fungal diseases.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Soil and Container:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Use well-draining potting soil for container-grown geraniums to prevent waterlogged 
        roots. Clay or plastic containers with drainage holes are ideal to ensure excess water 
        can escape.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Fertilizing::
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        During the growing season (spring to fall), feed your geraniums with a balanced 
        fertilizer every 4-6 weeks. Choose a fertilizer specifically formulated for flowering 
        plants to promote healthy blooms.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Pruning and Deadheading:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Regularly prune your geraniums to encourage bushy growth and remove spent blooms. 
        Deadheading (removing faded flowers) promotes continuous blooming and prevents seed 
        formation.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Overwintering:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        In colder climates, geraniums can be overwintered indoors. Before the first frost, 
        prune the plants back and transplant them into pots. Place them in a cool, bright 
        location indoors and reduce watering. Resume regular care in spring after the danger of 
        frost has passed.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Pest and Disease Control:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, spider mites, and caterpillars. Use 
        insecticidal soap or neem oil for natural pest control. Watch for signs of diseases 
        such as powdery mildew and treat promptly with fungicidal sprays.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Are geraniums perennial?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums, also known as Pelargoniums, are tender perennials in most climates. 
        They are often treated as annuals in colder regions due to their sensitivity to frost. 
        However, in warmer climates, they can survive and bloom year after year.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Are geraniums poisonous to dogs or cats?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums are not considered highly toxic to dogs or cats. While they may cause minor 
        gastrointestinal upset if ingested in large quantities, they are generally safe for pets. 
        However, it's always best to prevent pets from consuming any plant material to avoid 
        potential issues. Always consolt your vet if your pets consume any unknown material. For

    <h2>
        When is the best time to plant geraniums?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums can be planted outdoors after the danger of frost has passed in spring. 
        For indoor planting, they can be planted year-round.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        What are Geranium colors?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums come in a wide range of colors including red, pink, white, salmon, lavender, 
        and bicolor varieties.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Geraniums from seed?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        While geraniums can be grown from seed, they are more commonly propagated from stem 
        cuttings or purchased as young plants from nurseries due to the time and effort 
        required for germination and growth from seed.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
    <h2>
        Are geraniums hardy?
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Geraniums are generally hardy plants, especially in warm climates. They can tolerate 
        heat and drought conditions but may suffer from frost damage in colder regions.
    </p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Zonal Geraniums:
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
    <p>
        Zonal geraniums (Pelargonium Ã— hortorum) are a popular type of geranium known for their 
        distinctive dark bands or "zones" on their leaves. They are widely cultivated for their 
        colorful blooms and are commonly used in garden beds, containers, and hanging baskets.
